                <p style="font-size: large;">
                  ACM-DBIT chapter took birth in the year 2003 and is in its
                  20th year of enhancing Dbitians' lives by providing a platform
                  to enjoy learning. Teknack is one of the amazing battlefields
                  provided by ACM for students of not just DBIT but also of
                  other colleges to boost up their creative skills and pump up
                  their technical skills by amalgamating with newer ideas and
                  facts to build up Games that give the players an experience
                  that would last with them forever.
                  <br /><br />

                  An act once done becomes a memory‚Ä¶But an action consciously
                  done again and again makes an habit that upskills one's soul
                  to being a better human. And one of the best ways to carve
                  some good ideas into minds, especially of the young is through
                  a game and keeping this in mind, Teknack has produced some
                  value-enhancing games that give the player a chill down the
                  spine.
